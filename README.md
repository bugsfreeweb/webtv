- **Analysis**:
  - Uses `fetch` with `HEAD` requests to check channel online status.
  - Chart.js for doughnut chart visualization.
- **Persistence**:
  - Uses `localStorage` for playlists, favorites, and history.
- **Settings & Theming**:
  - Theme is persisted, toggled via UI.
  - All major UI elements are accessible via keyboard and mouse/touch.
